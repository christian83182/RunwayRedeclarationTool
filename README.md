# RunwayRedeclarationTool
A tool designed for the Software Engineering Group Project by Group 28 comprising Signe Rebassoo, Ioana Moisoiu, Christian Folkesson, Costi MC, Cem Gokhan.

The tool has been designed to act as an aid to the official process in recalculating runway parameters when an obstacle is present on the runway. The tool allows the user to define their own airfield though XML files, configure most of the runway settings from within the program using the Airfield Configuration tool, overlay the airfield on a user-defined image, create custom obstacles, change various relevant Airfield properties such as the Minimum Angle of Decent and Blast Distance policy. Configurations can be exported and imported as XML files, both the top and side view can be exported as images, the current state of runway parameters can be saved as a txt file. The application supports various colour blind modes and comes loaded with a user guide for further information as to how to use the application.
